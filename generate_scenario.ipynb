The company's quality control team has been struggling to identify the root causes of these defects, as they occur across different stages of the production process.\n",

      "Desired outcome:\n",
      "\n",
      "The company aims to pinpoint the specific factors in the manufacturing process that contribute to the increasing defect rate. By doing so, they can focus on improving those areas to reduce defects and improve product quality. The desired outcome is to develop a predictive model that can detect anomalies in real-time during the production process. This will enable the implementation of proactive measures to prevent defects and minimize customer complaints and returns.\n",

      "Available data:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Manufacturing data: The company collects data on various manufacturing parameters for each step of the production process. This includes information on machine settings, such as cutting speeds and pressures, as well as material properties, such as hardness and composition. The data is timestamped and associated with specific products and machines used.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Quality control data: The company maintains records of quality control inspections conducted on the finished products. This data captures measurements, such as dimensional tolerances, surface roughness, and material properties. Visual inspections are also recorded, noting any visible defects such as cracks or deformations. The data includes categorizations of defects and timestamps.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Maintenance data: The company tracks maintenance activities for machines, including scheduled maintenance and repairs. This data provides insights into the performance and reliability of machines over time, helping to identify any correlations between machine issues and the defect rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company currently uses statistical process control techniques and manual inspections for quality control. They also employ tools such as coordinate measuring machines (CMMs) and vision systems for dimensional accuracy and surface finish measurements, respectively. The available data sources, along with additional data generated from these quality control tools, can be utilized to develop a robust anomaly detection model.\n"
